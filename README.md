## To do list Android Application (Execom Workshop)

With this appliction you can view, add or remove tasks. Also you can mark tasks as complete or you
can mark completed tasks as not complete. In first tab you have a list of tasks  that you need to do
and in second tab you have list of tasks that you did. With checkbox you can indicate that task is 
done or not done. Also you can mark more than one task because the change is saved when you go to 
another activity or if you go to another tab.
